+
============================

To use this program, simply run the program with your desired file as an argument [E.G shipDeployer myFile.txt].
The program will return the number of ships capable of reaching the expedition site in question.

If you would like output to be written to a file, simply include the file as a second argument when you run the program
[E.G shipDeployer myFile.txt outputFile.txt]

To use debug features, simply use "debug" as your filename argument. The program will then guide you through the debug
input process.
<INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING DEBUG OUTPUT>
Example output:
32 <-- Normal output, matches debug file
225
WARN: 534 != 225 <-- Discrepancy found
55
87

Files must either be in the same folder as the program executable or be dictated as a full filepath
[E.G /home/myFile.txt]
