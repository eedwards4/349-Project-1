============================

To use this program, simply run the program with your desired file as an argument [E.G fuelAnalyzer myFile.txt].
The program will return the number of ships capable of reaching the expedition site in question.

To use debug features, simply use "debug" as your filename argument. The program will then query you for a file to
test it's output against. After that the program will query you for the file you want to analyze, and then it will
analyze the file. If there are any descrepencies between the two outputs, the program will add a line below the output
in question stating something like the following: "WARN: 61 != 111".

Files must either be in the same folder as the program excecutable or be dictated as a full filepath
[E.G /home/myFile.txt]
